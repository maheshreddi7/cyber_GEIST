            body = """ HERE ARE SOME TIPS...
               IF you know you have been hacked, here’s what you should do..
               You might have noticed that your passwords have changed or that you have received suspicious login alert emails from the online services you are using. If you are locked out of your online account and cannot recover it, you could be hacked. Here are some immediate steps you need to take if your online account has been hacked.

               First thing first: Notify your Friends, Family Members, and Followers

               Your friends and family members must be aware that one or more of your accounts have been hacked. The reasons are:
               1.Most hackers hack for financial gain, and when they get access to your account, they will try to scam or blackmail you or attempt to scam your friends or followers of your hacked account. We have had multiple clients hacked by their own friends on, e.g., Facebook, as hackers already controlled their accounts. This is a continuous loop where the hacker keeps hacking friends of a hacked account and then repeats it. It’s called social engineering. Think about it, if you got a message from your dad, brother, or best friend, to send you a code from your phone, would you not do it?
               2.The second reason is that the hacker might post sensitive or violating content on your own profile. If you are an employee or have important positions, this might get you in serious trouble.

                         1.Never pay a ransom
                                   If you have been hacked and the hackers have reached out to you demanding ransom, do not respond and definitely do not pay. By paying the hackers for their illegal activities, you are indirectly funding and supporting their operations, which means that they can continue hurting other people and businesses.

                                   If hackers approach you and ask for a ransom, you should contact your local law enforcement and file a police report. You can also hire a third party who can talk to the hackers and not directly involve yourself.

                                   What is important to know about most hackers is that they are in it for the money. The minute they understand you won’t give you any money, they will leave you alone and move onto their next victims. Most extortion attempts are shallow and won’t materialize.
                         
                         2.Suspicious Logins
                                   Today, most online services will let you know if you have been logged into their services with a different computer, IP, or browser. If you do not recognize a login, you should take immediate action and secure your account by:
                                   1.Changing the password
                                   2.Adding 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)
                                   3.Adding additional security levels the service provides        
                         
                         3.Unable to log in to your services?
                                   If the hackers have changed your password and/or email, and you are unable to log back into your own account, you should follow the service’s own protocol for hacked accounts. Often you can reset recent changes from the email alerts sent by the service. If that does not help, you should try to get in touch with the service’s customer support and see if they can help you.


                              Follow our Hacked Protocol
                If you are certain that you have been hacked, you should follow our protocol:
                        
                        1.Change passwords on all online accounts you still got access to and secure these as fast as possible.
                        2.Ensure that you have secured your main email account, changed the password, implemented a recovery email, and enabled Two-Factor Authentication.
                        3.Let all your friends and family members know that you have been hacked to ensure that they are not scammed by the hackers pretending to be you.
                        4.Do an assessment of which accounts have been hacked and what information the hackers have received about you and your network.
                        5.Do not create a new profile or account on the same platform you were hacked using the same credentials like email or phone number. This makes it much harder to recover your account.
